              From Thumbelina to Timberlina: Our Story

                Forty-three years ago, in the quaint town of Mirigama, Sri Lanka, a craftsman sat in a modest woodworking 
                factory, humming a tune from "Thumbelina."
              </p>
              <p className="italic">
                "Thumbelina, what's the difference if you're very small, When your heart is filled with love you're nine feet tall."
              </p>
              <p>
                Inspired by these words, he envisioned creating something tangibleâ€”something miniature that embodied the 
                vastness of love and craftsmanship, just like Thumbelina. This vision gave birth to "Timberlina," a pioneering 
                name in the manufacture and export of dollhouses in Sri Lanka.
